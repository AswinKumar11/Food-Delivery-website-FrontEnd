1. when we are building anything proper planning is needed(dont start code without it).
2. In components we can pass css as a inline css. which we can also store as an object and pass it in style with {}.
3. passing props to a component is similar to passing an argument to a function.
4. config driven ui- we can pass data in form of JSOn which can be used as a config for all the purposes like lets say I need specific data for specific region ......This is config driven ui.
5. Never use indexes as keys.
